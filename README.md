Collaboration work with Momoi Oki = Painter/Artist.  
I used just one (but powerful and beautiful) paint as a texture.  

## CUBE.unitypackage ##
use Black & White texture.

## TRII.unitypackage ##
use colored texture.  

You need to import particle pack. Because uploaded is except that package(...it is too heavy to put on GitHub).  
Read "sj_note_on_ParticlePack.txt" especially about the structure of dir.
